# StationBuilder

StationBuilder is an open source multiplayer immersive sim on Roblox. We use this repo to create new content in game.

## Concepts

*Components* (called Features in game) describe *Entities*. Which components entities have determines which *Systems* they are affected by. *Interactions* are ways entities can interact with one another directly, usually by changing their components to change which systems they interact with and how. 

AI actors use *Actions* and *Goals* to choose how they interact with the space.

*Tutorials* define *Stages* for players to reach in order to help them engage with the above content.

### Making Meaningful Content

Consider making your content play to these sources of meaning, as that will make your feature more fun! Even a boring action like picking up a stick is meaningful when its used to build your dream treehouse (Creation) or whack an enemy (Destruction).

- Destruction
- Excitement
- Competition
- Community
- Challenge
- Strategy
- Completion
- Power
- Creation
- Fantasy
- Story
- Design
- Discovery

Try to nail one of these:

- Autonomy: Does it create interesting decisions?
- Competence: Does it help you feel a sense of mastery and competence? 
- Relatedness: Does it create unique scenarios for interacting with others?
